# Language-detection-using-NLP
This project is a **Language Detection System** using **NLP**. It trains a machine learning model (likely Scikit-learn based) on a multilingual dataset to automatically classify the language of a given text input. It involves text preprocessing and feature extraction (like N-grams) to make predictions for languages such as 'Russian'.
